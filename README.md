This is a repository for a Bachelor's project 'Is it feasible to identify outputs of an arbitrary process at run time without excessively slowing down workflows?'

It is based upon meow_base by David Marchant, hence why the folder meow_base is and exact replica of his repository's stable branch as of June 10th 2023.
